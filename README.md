Started in 8th grade and developed continuously through senior year, this project was a collaborative effort to build a private messaging platform for Whitefish Bay students. Originally a simple chat room, it grew into a fully featured Google Chat alternative with direct messages and group rooms, media sharing, polls, custom bots, and other interactive tools. The site was primarily written in Typescript, HTML, and SASS, with a back-end powered by Node.js with Express and Socket.io.
