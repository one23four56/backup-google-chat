# Full Changelog

## Style

- **Summary:** Responsive font size and page layout, and other style optimizations for chromebooks

- **Details:**

  - The font size now responds to changes in the page size

    - This helps the page look about the same regardless of screen size

  - The main UI now uses a responsive (grid) layout

    - Zooming in (`ctrl` + `+`) and out (`ctrl` + `-`) now actually adjusts the page size instead of just the font size

    - Since the header is no longer a fixed size, the logo image and room emojis won't overflow off of the header anymore

    - The sidebar, header, message bar, and top bar can all be resized on the fly now, and all the other page contents will automatically adjust to make them fit

  - Online users list changes:

    - Now uses a slightly bolder font weight

    - DMs with unread messages now have a red circle on top of the chat bubble

## Mobile Support

- **Summary:** The site now has a dedicated stylesheet for mobile devices

- **Details:**

  - Added a dedicated stylesheet for mobile devices

  - Various mobile-only style tweaks to make the site usable

## Internal Changes

- **Summary:** Changed some internal systems for better performance and developer experience

- **Details:**

  - The client file bundler has been switched from [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/)

    - Greatly increased bundling speed

    - Built-in Typescript support greatly reduces build times

    - Built-in minification support is also nice

    - Also it is so much easier to configure

  - The site now uses SCSS instead of just regular CSS

    - This allows for easy modularization of CSS files

    - It also makes it way more enjoyable to write stylesheets

## Rooms

- **Summary:** Minor changes to room options

- **Details:**

  - Boolean (yes/no) room option selections are now done with a checkbox rather than two radio buttons

  - Options:

    - Added a permission option controlling who can add/remove bots from the room
  
## Authentication

- **Summary:** Massive speed improvements, new login page, and slight security improvements

- **Details:**

  - The login page has been restyled, it now:

    - Looks better

    - Uses a dark theme

    - Is mobile-friendly

  - The password resetting process is now much more intuitive

    - Before: enter email, click forgot password, enter email again, enter confirmation code, enter email AGAIN, set new password

    - Now: enter email, click forgot password, enter confirmation code, set new password

  - The password hashing function now uses twice as many iterations

    - Passwords hashed using the old function are no longer valid; you will have to set a new password if you made one before this

    - Combined with multi-layer hashing, this grants an effective hash time increase of 8x

      - Increased hash time = slightly more security in the event of a data breach

  - Raw passwords are no longer stored in cookies

  - Authentication is now 8,970% faster than it was in v3.0.3

    - This significantly reduces request processing times (the site loads way faster)

    - To put it in perspective, the new system can authenticate ~90 requests before the old one would even be able to finish processing one

## Schedules

- **Summary:** You are now able to input your schedule, which shows other users what class you are in and gives you a countdown until your class ends

- **Details:**

  - Added a set schedule button to the header

    - Once you set a schedule, this is replaced with a countdown to when your class ends

  - Your current class in now displayed below your name in the online lists (see [below](#sidebar))

## Sidebar

- **Summary:** User sidebar items now show the activity state of users

- **Details:**

  - Items now have a colored dot in the bottom right corner of the user's profile photo that changes color depending on the activity state of the user

  - Items now have a subtitle which displays the text version of their activity state as well as the current class they are in (i.e. 'BUSY - Chemistry' or 'ACTIVE - Study Hall')

  - Added 4 activity states:

    - ONLINE (lighter green): This user is connected to BGC and has been active within the last 2.5 minutes

    - ACTIVE (darker green): This user is connected and currently has the BGC tab open

    - BUSY (orange): This user is connected and has not been active within the last 2.5 minutes

    - OFFLINE (gray): This user is not connected

## Stats

- **Summary:** Remade the stats page to focus on actual statistics instead of leaderboards

- **Details:**

  - The stats page now uses a dark theme

  - The stats page has been split into 4 sections:

    - Today

      - Has a chart showing the numbers of messages sent each hour over the last 12 hours

      - Says the average messages/hour over the last 12 hours

      - Says who was the most active over the last 12 hours

    - Last 7 Days

      - Has a chart showing the numbers of messages sent each day over the last 7 days

      - Says the average messages/day over the last 7 days

      - Says who was the most active over the last 7 days

    - Leaderboards

      - Has 3 leaderboards: messages sent all time, messages sent last 7 days, and messages sent today

      - Leaderboards still show the top 10 by default, but now they also have a 'show more' button which loads 10 more people, up until there is nobody left to show

    - Word Cloud

      - Allows you to generate a word cloud of the 250 most used words in the group

      - The word cloud can be saved as either a png, jpeg, or webp

      - Configurable font size, random color theme

## Data

- **Summary:** All data is now automatically backed up on-site, which should help prevent data corruption issues

- **Details:**

  - All data is now written to two separate files at two separate times, so if one file is corrupted the other should still be available

  - If the main file has been corrupted, the site will now automatically attempt to load the on-site backup instead of crashing right away

    - If the on-site backup is not available, the site will still crash

  - Many data functions have been optimized to reduce memory usage

## Client Optimizations

- **Summary:** Rooms are now loaded when they are opened, instead of all being loaded at once when the tab is opened

- **Details:**

  - If a room has unread messages, that is now shown right away, instead of after all the messages are loaded in

  - Rooms are now lazily loaded, meaning that they are only loaded when they are needed

    - This eliminates the lag spike upon loading the page that was present on some devices

    - Additionally, site memory consumption has been reduced as unused rooms are no longer wasting resources

  - Rooms are now initialized one-by-one instead of all at once

    - Room data that cannot be lazily loaded is now loaded one-at-a-time, which reduces load on the server with virtually no speed penalty

    - The loading screen now says 'Loading room x of y' while initializing rooms

- **Notes:** The terms 'rooms' and 'room' used above are referring to both rooms and DMs

## Messages

- **Summary:** Multiple files can now be attached to the same message

- **Details:**

  - Attached images are now displayed inside of a container which is always the same size regardless of the image size

    - This greatly simplifies scrolling since the size of the container is known ahead of time, allowing for the removal of the old, complex image scrolling logic

    - Images are now scaled down to fit while preserving proportions, so large images no longer take up the entire screen

  - Clicking on an image container now opens a full-sized version of the image

    - Some information about the file is displayed on a sidebar to the left, along with options to download, open in a new tab, and change the background color of the image

  - Up to 3 files can now be attached to a message

    - Simply copy + paste or drag + drop another file into the message bar after one has already been uploaded

  - Updated how youtube video thumbnails are displayed

    - Youtube video thumbnails now have a red outline and a play button in the middle to distinguish them from regular images

    - If there are multiple youtube video links in a message, multiple video thumbnails will be displayed

      - Additionally, thumbnails will still be displayed if there is media attached to a message

    - Shortened (youtu.be) video links now display a thumbnail too

## Minor Changes

- The site will now always use Google's [Noto Color Emoji](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Color+Emoji) font for emojis instead of whatever system font is available. This means that emojis will now look the same on every device.

## Bugs Fixed

All of the bugs listed here were present in some or all older versions but have been patched in this version and are confirmed to no longer be present.

- Whenever you send a message, a sound is played, even if the 'play a sound when you send a message' option is off

- Deleting the most recent message causes the client to get stuck in an infinite loop, resulting in a disconnection

- The Ukraine flag emoji shows up as 'UA' on some devices

- When a message contains a link to YouTube, a video icon is attached, even if there is no video being linked to
