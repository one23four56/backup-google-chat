# Full Changelog

## Style

- **Summary:** Responsive font size and page layout, and other style optimizations for chromebooks

- **Details:**

  - The font size now responds to changes in the page size

    - This helps the page look about the same regardless of screen size

  - The main UI now uses a responsive (grid) layout

    - Zooming in (`ctrl` + `+`) and out (`ctrl` + `-`) now actually adjusts the page size instead of just the font size

    - Since the header is no longer a fixed size, the logo image and room emojis won't overflow off of the header anymore

    - The sidebar, header, message bar, and top bar can all be resized on the fly now, and all the other page contents will automatically adjust to make them fit

## Mobile Support

- **Summary:** The site now has a dedicated stylesheet for mobile devices

- **Details:**

  - Added a dedicated stylesheet for mobile devices

  - Various mobile-only style tweaks to make the site usable

## Internal Changes

- **Summary:** Changed some internal systems for better performance and developer experience

- **Details:**

  - The client file bundler has been switched from [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/)

    - Greatly increased bundling speed

    - Built-in Typescript support greatly reduces build times

    - Built-in minification support is also nice

    - Also it is so much easier to configure

  - The site now uses [SCSS / Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) instead of just regular CSS

    - This allows for easy modularization of CSS files

    - It also makes it way more enjoyable to write stylesheets
