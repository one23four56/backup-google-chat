# Full Changelog

## Style

- **Summary:** Responsive font size and page layout, and other style optimizations for chromebooks

- **Details:**

  - The font size now responds to changes in the page size

    - This helps the page look about the same regardless of screen size

  - The main UI now uses a responsive (grid) layout

    - Zooming in (`ctrl` + `+`) and out (`ctrl` + `-`) now actually adjusts the page size instead of just the font size

    - Since the header is no longer a fixed size, the logo image and room emojis won't overflow off of the header anymore

    - The sidebar, header, message bar, and top bar can all be resized on the fly now, and all the other page contents will automatically adjust to make them fit

  - Online users list changes:

    - Now uses a slightly bolder font weight

    - DMs with unread messages now have a red circle on top of the chat bubble

## Mobile Support

- **Summary:** The site now has a dedicated stylesheet for mobile devices

- **Details:**

  - Added a dedicated stylesheet for mobile devices

  - Various mobile-only style tweaks to make the site usable

## Internal Changes

- **Summary:** Changed some internal systems for better performance and developer experience

- **Details:**

  - The client file bundler has been switched from [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/)

    - Greatly increased bundling speed

    - Built-in Typescript support greatly reduces build times

    - Built-in minification support is also nice

    - Also it is so much easier to configure

  - The site now uses SCSS instead of just regular CSS

    - This allows for easy modularization of CSS files

    - It also makes it way more enjoyable to write stylesheets

## Rooms

- **Summary:** Minor changes to room options

- **Details:**

  - Boolean (yes/no) room option selections are now done with a checkbox rather than two radio buttons

  - Options:

    - Added a permission option controlling who can add/remove bots from the room
  
## Authentication

- **Summary:** New login page and slight security improvements

- **Details:**

  - The login page has been restyled, it now:

    - Looks better

    - Uses a dark theme

    - Is mobile-friendly

  - The password resetting process is now much more intuitive

    - Before: enter email, click forgot password, enter email again, enter confirmation code, enter email AGAIN, set new password

    - Now: enter email, click forgot password, enter confirmation code, set new password

  - The password hashing function now uses twice as many iterations

    - Passwords hashed using the old function are no longer valid; you will have to set a new password if you made one before this

    - Combined with multi-layer hashing, this grants an effective hash time increase of 8x

      - Increased hash time = slightly more security in the event of a data breach

  - Raw passwords are no longer stored in cookies

## Schedules

- **Summary:** You are now able to input your schedule, which shows other users what class you are in and gives you a countdown until your class ends

- **Details:**

  - Added a set schedule button to the header

    - Once you set a schedule, this is replaced with a countdown to when your class ends

  - Your current class in now displayed below your name in the online lists (see [below](#sidebar))

## Sidebar

- **Summary:** User sidebar items now show the activity state of users

- **Details:**

  - Items now have a colored dot in the bottom right corner of the user's profile photo that changes color depending on the activity state of the user

  - Items now have a subtitle which displays the text version of their activity state as well as the current class they are in (i.e. 'BUSY - Chemistry' or 'ACTIVE - Study Hall')

  - Added 4 activity states:

    - ONLINE (lighter green): This user is connected to BGC and has been active within the last 2.5 minutes

    - ACTIVE (darker green): This user is connected and currently has the BGC tab open

    - BUSY (orange): This user is connected and has not been active within the last 2.5 minutes

    - OFFLINE (gray): This user is not connected

## Bugs Fixed

All of the bugs listed here were present in some or all older versions but have been patched in this version and are confirmed to no longer be present.

- Whenever you send a message, a sound is played, even if the 'play a sound when you send a message' option is off

- Deleting the most recent message causes the client to get stuck in an infinite loop, resulting in a disconnection
