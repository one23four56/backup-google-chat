## Backups

- Created a new, easier method for making off-site backups

- Off-site backups now back up the entire site instead of just the data

  - Full-site restores now take less than 10 minutes, instead of the 2+ hour ordeal that they were before

- **Note:** These changes don't affect the site itself, but should help in the event of data loss

## Bugs Fixed

All bugs listed below were present in some or all older versions but have been patched in v3.3.4

- The site is unable to recognize non-segmented (pre-v3.3.0) rooms, causing a crash when it encounters one*

- The `/spread` Lab Bot command has a typo*

- When a message triggers a bot filter, all commands in the message are disregarded

- The `/quote` command does not work

- *([chromium-based browsers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_(web_browser)#Browsers_based_on_Chromium) only)* Inserting emojis via the emoji button in the message bar does not work

\* = This bug was patched in a hotfix before the official patch was released
