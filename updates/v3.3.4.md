- Bug fixes

<hr>

# Full Changelog

## Backups

- Added a new, easier method for creating off-site backups

- Off-site backups now back up the entire site instead of just the data

  - Full-site restores now take less than 10 minutes, instead of the 2+ hour ordeal that they were before

- **Note:** These changes don't affect the site itself, but should help in the event of data loss

## Bugs Fixed

All bugs listed below were present in some or all older versions but have been patched in v3.3.4

- The site is unable to recognize non-segmented (pre-v3.3.0) rooms, causing a crash when it encounters one*

- The `/spread` Lab Bot command has a typo*

- When a message triggers a bot filter, all commands in the message are disregarded

- The `/quote` command does not work

- *([chromium-based browsers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_(web_browser)#Browsers_based_on_Chromium) only)* Inserting emojis via the emoji button in the message bar does not work

- *([chromium-based browsers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_(web_browser)#Browsers_based_on_Chromium) only)* The command helper has a horizontal scroll bar

\* = This bug was patched in a hotfix before the official patch was released

# Notes

It took a few days, but the site is now fully functioning again following the deletion. Restoring the site to a backup took over 2 hours alone, as I had to rebuild the file structure, upload the data (which of course was in the pre-v3.3 format), and then fix all the configuration issues that arose. Following that, a site-crashing bug popped up the next day, which was luckily pretty trivial to fix. Due to the whole ordeal, I decided to do something I haven't done before and release a 4th patch for an update, just to solidify the few hotfixes that had been done and fix some more bugs that arose. Most significantly, this patch overhauls the backup process, making it significantly easier to create backups (just one click of a button) and significantly easier to rollback to them as well. In the event that my dad deletes the site again, or all the files get corrupted, or some other scenario that I can't even think of happens, then not only will the latest backup be more up-to-date, but restoring should be an easy process. I don't know what it is with this update, but for every patch so far I have found myself up at 1 AM trying to get it out before school the next day, and this one is no exception. I guess here's to hoping that this time no more unpredictable events come up and this patch can finish off version 3.3, so I can finally start working on the next major update, but who knows at this point.
