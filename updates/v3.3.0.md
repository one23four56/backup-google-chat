## Security

- Patched a critical path traversal ([CWE-24](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/24.html)) vulnerability

- Updated dependencies

## Users

## Minor Changes

- The search page (`/search`) has been removed (it was broken and hidden since v3.0.0)

- You can now search for users by last name

## Bugs Fixed

All bugs listed below were present in some or all older versions but have been patched in v3.3.0

- If someone is muted while the room options are updated, that user is never unmuted, even when the mute expires

- If a file has been removed but its entry is still present in the ledger, auto-delete gets stuck in an infinite loop trying to delete it
