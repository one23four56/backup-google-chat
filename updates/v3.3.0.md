## Bugs Fixed

All bugs listed below were present in some or all older versions but have been patched in v3.3.0

- If someone is muted while the room options are updated, they are never unmuted, even when the mute expires

- If a file has been removed but its entry is still present in the ledger, auto-delete gets stuck in an infinite loop trying to delete it*

- Logging out does not work

- Whenever the emoji selector is opened it is scrolled all the way to the bottom

- When you are removed from a room that you have an active notification for, that notification is not dismissed

- If an invite is cancelled while you are online, it is not removed from the notification list

- If a file upload fails, its sidebar alert is never closed

- If a message is sent/received in between the time the site loads and you click "Load More Messages", duplicate messages are be loaded

\* = This bug was patched in a hotfix before v3.3.0 was released

# Notes

This update was supposed to be the game update, but as you can see that did not end up happening. I started work on this in the summer, and planned to do a "site revamp" of sorts before starting work on games, to add all the features I had in the back of my head but never got around to adding. I kinda went overboard with that and spent all of my time working on various unrelated small features instead of games (plus this summer I was just more busy overall and had less time to work on this), so when I finally got around to starting games I was in a rush. As it turns out, adding games takes much more work that it would seem. After weeks spent working on backend stuff, school rolled around, and in a mix of being burnt out and busy, I just forgot about working on this site and shelved the update. I had been meaning to revive it for a while until the crashing became unbearable and forced my hand. This new time constraint and the need for stability fixes meant that I was forced to delay games to the next update (they are still coming I promise) and release the site revamps alone, with some stability stuff. Anyways, I hope this update ends up being good (I have a feeling some changes might be controversial lol), and the next update will be games along with another big feature I have been planning out that I think would be really cool. It is currently 1 AM on a school night, so with that I am going to sleep.
