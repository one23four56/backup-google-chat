    <h3>Versioning Notice:</h3>
    <p>If you have been paying attention to update versions, you may be confused as the last update was called v1.6.2, and this is v3.0. There was not a jump over v2, every update was just renamed because the old system sucked. All updates that used to begin with v1 now begin with v2. All updates that used to begin with "old v1" are now just v1. This is to prevent confusion, as having a set of updates called "old version 1" and other called "version 1" makes no sense. Additionally, the DM update (formerly old v1.9) is now v2 because v2 was skipped over for some reason.</p>

# Full Changelog

## Rooms

- **Summary:** Support for individual chat rooms has been added, rather than having the whole site be one room.

- **Details:**

  - Completely overhauled the entire client-side channel system

    - Client-side channels are now more modularized and significantly easier to work with

    - Performance has been improved, specifically relating to editing and deleting messages, as the site no longer has to redraw every message for a minor update to one

    - Added a new message bar system that is not affected by many issues that plagued the old one, as well as being easier to work with

    - Added a top bar to switch between different views (chat, details, members, options) in a room

      - Chat is where messages are sent

      - Details shows description, rules, name, and emoji (editable by room owner)

      - Members shows room members and bots (can be added/removed from here)

      - Options shows the room options (also editable by room owner)

    - New sidebar system: each room has its own sidebar, which has options to open the room bots, stats, and archive pages as well as the list of online users

  - Added a new server-side room system

    - Essentially each room is like a tiny copy of the old site

    - Necessitated large changes to many modules in order for them to work properly

- **Notes:** it may not seem like much, but this was huge. the entire site was written to function as a single chat room, and was worked on under that assumption for just over a year. coming in and changing that all of a sudden has been a massive pain and was only possible because of the large amount of time i had while working on this update. before this i didn't even think it would be possible. even then, at the time of writing this, it is not even fully complete. i've got no idea what the future holds for this site, but i am hoping that this new system is able to last as long as the old one did. also specific details were a bit lacking in this section because i totally forgot i was supposed to keep an update log until rooms were basically finished

## Event Handling & Client-Server Communication

- **Summary:** New and better system for handling communications between the clients and the server

- **Details:**

  - Event handlers are now generated on a per-client basis, meaning every time you connect you get your own custom event handlers

  - Increased security against malformed requests, so the site should crash less

  - New system is able to handle rooms, which was completely impossible with the old one

## Webhooks

- **Summary:** Minor changes to webhooks on the surface, but there were some pretty significant internal changes.

- **Details:**

  - Large internal changes to webhooks in order for them to work with rooms
  
    - Webhook messages are now handled the exact same as normal messages

  - The message tag for webhooks messages has been changed from 'BOT' to 'WEBHOOK' to prevent confusion for new users, and the tag's background color is darker to make it easier to read.

  - Slight changes to webhook creation UI, as the public/private selection is now made via a confirm (yes/no) popup instead of a checkbox.

  - Changed the messages that show up when you edit/create/delete a webhook to be more grammatically correct and more consistent with each other.

## Bots

- **Summary:** Bots now work in rooms, the bots page was updated, some bots have had name and/or image changes, and polly has been upgraded

- **Details:**
  
  - Bots now work in rooms.

    - The room owner can choose which bots to allow in the room.

  - Bots can now only be activated once per message to prevent spam (i.e. sending a message like "/inspiro /time help" will now only run one of the commands).

    - Filter-activated bots are exempt from this rule.

  - Bot changes:

    - School Time Checker V3:

      - Renamed back to "Time Bot" to prevent confusion for new users

      - Updated the image

    - Archive Bot:

      - Updated the image to match with the archive icon

      - `/stats` command now omits archive size data from the message if given an argument

    - Random Bot: Updated the image

    - Polly:

      - Added duplicate vote checking since apparently there was none before

      - There are now dots after every option indicating the number of votes it has

        - Blue dots (ðŸ”µ) indicate someone else's vote, while green dots (ðŸŸ¢) indicate your vote

      - You can now update or remove your vote after it has been casted

      - You are no longer required to be online when a poll is created in order to vote in it, meaning you can vote in a poll that was started before you connected

      - Other internal improvements

  - Bots are now shown in the members tab of a room, rather than on their own page

    - Room owners can add and remove bots from there

    - Bots have an info icon which shows an info card for the bot when it is clicked

- **Notes:** i am just realizing now that polly was like really poorly implemented... like seriously i am surprised it didn't break more often

## Auto Moderator

- **Summary:** Automod strictness is now customizable by room owners, and automod has a new logo

- **Details:**

  - Internal updates to make mutes room-specific and add customizable settings

    - Room owners can change the strictness and number of warnings before a mute

  - Classic anti-spam (rate limiter) changes: Rate limiter is ever-so-slightly less strict by default

  - Reactive anti-spam changes:

    - Now capable of reacting to any rate of constant messages

    - Now comes in to effect sooner

  - New image that should load faster than the old one

## Command Helper

- **Summary:** Added a command helper that shows all the commands when typing

- **Details:**

  - Typing a slash (/) will open the helper

  - The helper shows all the commands, and narrows the commands down as you type

  - Once you have reached one possible command, the helper will show arguments for that command

## Messages

- **Summary:** Changes to message tags and client-side image loading

- **Details:**

  - Patched an XSS vulnerability in tags (note: it was not actually possible to exploit this vulnerability at the time of the patch, which is why it was not patched for so long, as it was not seen as an issue)

  - Messages can now have multiple tags

    - Editing a message now adds the 'EDITED' tag to the list of tags, rather than replacing whatever the tag was with 'EDITED'

    - This patches the ability to impersonate someone by creating a webhook with their name and image, sending a message, and then editing it

  - Client-side images on messages are now loaded differently

    - This allows for more control over how images interact with scrolling

    - Redraws of messages with images now consume less resources as the image is only reloaded if it is required to be

  - Urls like 'google.com' and 'ecosia.org' now show up as clickable links

## Direct Messages

- **Summary:** Direct messages between users are now saved on the server, and bots now work in direct messages

- **Details:**

  - You can now send a direct message to someone who is not online

  - Direct messages are now saved on the server instead of being removed whenever you reload the page or switch clients

    - You can choose not to save direct messages in order to make them use the old behavior

  - Messages sent in direct message conversations can now be edited, deleted, reacted to, and replied to

  - In order to start a direct message conversation you now must send an invite to the recipient and they must accept it

  - Bots are now supported in direct messages

    - Archive Bot, Random Bot, and Time Bot are the only bots allowed

## Invites

- **Summary:** In order to start a direct message conversation with someone or add them to a room you now have to send an invite

- **Details:**

  - When you have pending invites, an invite button will show up that shows all pending invites upon being clicked

  - Two types of invites have been added:

    - Room invites are sent to you when someone invites you to a room, and will add you to the room upon being accepted

    - DM invites are sent when someone wants to start a direct message conversation with you, and will start a DM with the sender upon being accepted

## Mediashare

- **Summary:** Added Mediashare, a new system for sharing files

- **Details:**

  - Files are no longer stored on the archive directly, now they are stored separately

    - This reduces resource consumption, as the archive (which is always loaded on memory) is now significantly smaller

  - Mediashare can handle any type of file, although this is not implemented yet and it currently only handles images

  - Files up to 5 MB are now supported, quintupling the old limit of 1 MB

  - Files are now uploaded before you send the message, unlike the old system where they were uploaded when the message was sent

    - This reduces the time it takes for messages containing images to send

  - There is now a limit of 100 MB of files per room

    - If the size is above 100 MB, new files will not be sent unless the auto delete option is on

    - Auto delete will automatically delete old files to create space for new files when the size of all the files is larger than 100 MB

  - Files are now stored more efficiently, being stored as raw binary data instead of as a base 64 url

## Style Changes

- **Summary:** Minor style changes to improve the look of the site

- **Details:**

  - Images on sidebar alerts are now 20% smaller

  - Tweaked the look of reactions that you reacted with to be less jarring and ugly

## Initial Popups

- **Summary:** Added a new popup that shows highlights from the latest update and tweaked the welcome popup

- **Details:**

  - Popups that open when you open the page are now called initial popups

    - So far the only 2 popups classified this way are the welcome popup and the what's new display

  - Added a new setting 'Always show initial popups' that makes the site always show every initial popup, even if their conditions for showing are not met

    - Mainly used for debugging but someone might want to use it I guess

    - Defaults to off

  - Welcome popup changes:

    - The welcome popup will now only show up once per device, unless the 'Always show initial popups' setting is on

    - The welcome popup now contains a section about following school rules

  - Added the What's New display, a new initial popup that shows up whenever a new update is released

    - The popup contains an update image, the update name, some highlights of the update, and a link to the update in the logs

    - The popup will only show up once per update unless the 'Always show initial popups' setting is on

## Statuses

- **Summary:** Internal status system revamped and new status setter UI

- **Details:**

  - Status system revamped

    - Statuses are now in your user data, meaning they can be accessed (and by extension used) more easily

  - Statuses no longer send messages when updated or reset

    - You can now set a status even when you are muted

  - New status setter UI, now includes an emoji selector

  - Added a status button to the header

## Reading Messages

- **Summary:** It now shows when messages have been read by other users

- **Details:**

  - When a message has been read by someone, their profile picture is now shown below it

  - An 'Unread Messages' bar is now shown above messages that you have not yet read

  - Rooms and DMs on the sidebar are now bolded when they have unread messages

  - When opening a room or DM, you will now be autoscrolled to the 'Unread Messages' bar (if it exists) instead of to the bottom

## Minor Changes

- The loading screen now says what step of loading it is on, rather than just 'Loading...'

- Added an emoji button in the message bar

- Loading in old messages is now done via a button instead of being done automatically when scrolling up

- You can now drag and drop images in to the message bar, which has the same behavior as pasting them

- The archive loader option to hide images is no longer present due to Mediashare rendering it useless

- The setting 'Hide welcome popup' has been removed

- Auto reconnect now reloads the page

## Bugs Fixed

All bugs listed here were present in older versions but have been patched in this update and are no longer present.  

- Editing or deleting a selecting webhook messes up the display on the message bar (i.e. if you select a webhook named 'web' and change its name to 'hook', the bar will still say 'Send a message as web...')

- You are unable to edit, delete, reply, or react to the first message sent in a room

- ([chromium-based browsers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_(web_browser)#Browsers_based_on_Chromium) only) The scroll bars on the sidebar show up even when there is nothing to scroll

- While you are supposed to be autoscrolled to the bottom upon opening a room no matter what, this only actually works when autoscroll is set to always on

- When old messages are loaded in, you are autoscrolled to the top instead of staying scrolled to wherever you were

- When old messages are loaded in, the same set of messages can sometimes be loaded in twice (partially patched in v2.3.0, now fully patched)

- Attempting to send an image with a size greater than 1 megabyte results in the server abruptly closing your connection, causing a client-side crash

- When receiving a message containing an image, autoscroll does not fully scroll down

- The initial scroll down when opening a room does not fully scroll down if a message containing an image is loaded in

- When trying to set or reset your password, the email is not sent and it just says "An error ocurred"

- Attempting to select another message immediately after selecting one does nothing

- Other minor bugs

**Note:** Rooms were not added until this version, so all bugs listed as affecting rooms affected the main chat room in previous versions, as it was the only room

# Notes

This has been the largest update ever by a long shot, encompassing 110 commits, over 15k lines of code, 91 files, and almost 3 months of on-and-off work. It may not seem *that* big on the surface; however, the site internals have been near-completely overhauled, hence the name. Adding chat rooms alone took almost a month, since it required so many other things to also be updated and almost spiraled completely out of control. Only on the final days of August was the site actually fully usable by someone without direct access to modify site data. It seriously took that long due to the amount of changes. I was going to release this just as school started, but decided to delay that because I didn't want to spend the last days of summer sitting in my basement. I was also going to add a lot more features, but I decided that I had to draw the line somewhere or the update would never release. There will probably never be an update like this again, since after working on one update for the whole summer I can confidently say that the approach of rapid, small updates is significantly better. I don't really know if there is anything else to say here, so enjoy the update I guess.

P.S. sorry for any old features that no longer work I will try to fix them ASAP in a patch since I didn't have enough time to find and fix them all during the update work
