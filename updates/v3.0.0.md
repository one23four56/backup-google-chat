    <h3>Versioning Notice:</h3>
    <p>If you have been paying attention to update versions, you may be confused as the last update was called v1.6.2, and this is v3.0. There was not a jump over v2, every update was just renamed because the old system sucked. All updates that used to begin with v1 now begin with v2. All updates that used to begin with "old v1" are now just v1. This is to prevent confusion, as having a set of updates called "old version 1" and other called "version 1" makes no sense. Additionally, the DM update (formerly old v1.9.0) is now the v2.0.0 so the subversion numbers stay the same (style update was v1.1, is now v2.1, if dm update became v1.9 style would have to be v2.0, since v2.0 was skipped over for some reason).</p>
