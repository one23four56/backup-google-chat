## Bugs Fixed

All bugs listed here were present in older versions but have been patched in this update and are no longer present.

- The status setter allows you to set a status with an emoji of '+'

- When attempting to send a blank message with an image, automod blocks the message

- 'Text is too short' error shows up too much (re-patched, v3.0.0 broke the original patch from v2.6.1)

- Deleting a message that is next to another deleted message causes strange joining behavior
