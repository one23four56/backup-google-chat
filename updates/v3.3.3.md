# Notes

This was supposed to be an exciting update, with this patch being the largest one ever to date; however, my dad somehow managed to accidentally delete the entire site off of the server, causing a month's worth of data loss. The site has been rolled back to the last off-site backup, which was taken on January 30th, just before the release of v3.3 and the transition to a segmented archive. Following the addition of data loss prevention features in v3.2 and v3.3, I figured that I didn't need take backups as frequently, but obviously I was not expecting an edge case like this. This was the most catastrophic data loss event in site history, with the archive for every room being lost, along with all the media for all but one. As opposed to previous data loss events, which only affected one file and were largely mitigated by on-site backups, there is not much that can be done to prevent something similar to this happening in the future, apart from more frequent off-site backups. Alongside this update, backups will now be taken weekly instead of monthly, just in case another unpredictable data loss event occurs. In the meantime, I guess we can all just pretend that the entire month of February did not happen.
