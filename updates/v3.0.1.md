## Bugs Fixed

All bugs listed here were present in older versions but have been patched in this update and are no longer present.

- Adding users to the site does not work

- When creating a room, no matter what you do, the error message 'The rawMembers field is blank' shows up*

- Your profile picture in the header does not load*

- If you are not in any rooms, the sidebar does not even show up*

- After changing a room's options or adding/removing a bot, the room's bot list appears empty, the 'Add bots' button doesn't work, and typing '/' doesn't open the command helper

- When a room's options are updated while you have unread messages, the room's sidebar item is reset, making it unclear that there are unread messages

- New rooms/dms are not marked as unread until you have opened them for the first time, even if there are unread messages

\* = This bug was patched in a hotfix before the official patch was released
