# Full Changelog

## Rooms

- All room info messages now say who did the action that triggered the message

- Modernized the room members page

  - Members can now be searched and filtered

- Added the option to mute people (prevent them from sending new messages)

  - By default, only room owners can mute people, but this can be changed in room options (Permissions > Mute People)

  - **Mutes will naturally end after the time set by the muter (max 10 mins); however, the room owner has the option to end mutes early**

- Added the option to kick people (temporarily remove them from a room)

  - By default, only room owners can kick people, but this can be changed in room options (Permissions > Kick People)

- Added the room member actions menu, which shows options to remove, mute, or kick a member from a room

  - Can be opened by:

    - Right clicking someone's profile picture in chat

    - **Right clicking on someone in the sidebar**

    - Right clicking or pressing the three dots on someone in the room members page

  - The menu will show up when someone's user card is opened (can be disabled in settings)

- **permission revamp**

- **poll time adjust**

- **rooms with one member make the owner**

## Settings

- Added setting "Show room member actions (remove/mute/kick) in user profiles" (default: off) under People > Profile Room Actions

## Minor Changes

- In the archive viewer, replies now link to the message that they are replying to

- The site now loads slightly faster

- Quote bot random commands (`/quote random`, `/quote guess`) no longer quote commands and  guesses/hints

- Status update notifications are now auto-dismissed and replaced if the sender updates their status again before the notification is read

## Bugs Fixed

All bugs listed below were present in some or all older versions but have been patched in v3.3.8

- Rooms with one message are not properly converted to the new last read message format, causing an unremovable notification*

- Attempting to open a room with one or zero messages causes a crash*

- The link to the largest file on the stats page does not work

- Navigating to `/chat` without a trailing slash prevents all site files from loading

- Message authors' profile pictures can sometimes get squished

- You still receive status update notifications from people you've blocked

- If you get removed from a room and rejoin it in the same session, new messages sent in that room fail to render until you reload

- If you get removed from a room and then a message is sent in another room, the sidebar item for the room that you were removed from reappears until you reload

- When someone is removed from the room, their read message icons are not deleted

\* = This bug was patched in a hotfix before the official patch was released
