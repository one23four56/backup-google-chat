# Full Changelog

## Minor Changes

- **mute**

- In the archive viewer, replies now link to the message that they are replying to

- The site now loads slightly faster

- Quote bot random commands (`/quote random`, `/quote guess`) no longer quote commands and  guesses/hints

- Status update notifications are now auto-dismissed and replaced if the sender updates their status again before the notification is read

## Bugs Fixed

All bugs listed below were present in some or all older versions but have been patched in v3.3.8

- Rooms with one message are not properly converted to the new last read message format, causing an unremovable notification*

- Attempting to open a room with one or zero messages causes a crash*

- The link to the largest file on the stats page does not work

- Navigating to `/chat` without a trailing slash prevents all site files from loading

- Message authors' profile pictures can sometimes get squished

- You still receive status update notifications from people you've blocked

- If you get removed from a room and rejoin it in the same session, new messages sent in that room fail to render until you reload

- If you get removed from a room and then a message is sent in another room, the sidebar item for the room that you were removed from reappears until you reload

- When someone is removed from the room, their read message icons are not deleted

\* = This bug was patched in a hotfix before the official patch was released
