# Full Changelog

## Rooms

- All room info messages now say who did the action that triggered the message

- Modernized the room members page

  - Members can now be searched and filtered

- Changes to muting

  - Room members can now manually mute people via the member actions menu
  
    - By default, this is reserved for room owners, but this can be changed in room options (Permissions > Mute People)

  - On the members page, muted people now have a "MUTED" tag and a countdown to when the mute ends next to their name

  - Mutes will still end naturally after the time set by the muter; however, the room owner now has the option to end mutes early

- Added kicking

  - Kicked users are temporarily removed from the room for a certain amount of time and then automatically added back

    - A notification is sent to kicked users which tells them who kicked them and when the kick ends, and provides an option to leave the room

    - During this time, kicked users cannot be invited back to the room, even if they leave or get removed

  - Room members can manually kick people via the member actions menu

    - By default, this is reserved for room owners, but this can be changed in room options (Permissions > Kick People)

  - On the members page, kicked people have a "KICKED" tag and a countdown to when the kick ends next to their name

  - The room owner has the option to end kicks early

- Room owners can no longer be kicked or muted

- **Note:** Muting existed prior to v3.4.0, but it was unstable, reserved exclusively for AutoMod, and did not support early unmuting. Kicking did not exist prior to v3.4.0.

- Added the room member actions menu, which shows options to remove, mute, or kick a member from a room

  - Can be opened by:

    - Right clicking someone's profile picture in chat

    - Right clicking on someone in the sidebar

    - Right clicking or pressing the three dots on someone in the room members page

  - If enabled (Settings > People > Profile Room Actions), the menu will also show up when user profiles are opened

- Non-owners are now able to edit room names/emojis, descriptions, and rules

  - Controlled by the "Edit room name and emoji", "Edit room description", and "Add or remove room rules" room permission options (all default to owner)

- Increased the room description character limit from 100 to 250 characters

- Added confirmation popups for changing the room name and emoji

- Adjusted the duration of certain polls

  - Invite, mute, and kick user polls now all last 1 minute

  - Claim room ownership polls now last 15 minutes

  - All other polls still last the default 5 minutes

- Room owners can now delete other peoples's messages

  - This must be enabled in room options under Miscellaneous (default: off)

  - System/Info messages can't be deleted, even if this option is on

- Added room abandonment protection; when only one member is left in a room they are now automatically made the owner

- Room owners can now renounce ownership when there are 2 or more members in a room (previously was 3)

- Added the option to display a crown icon next to messages sent by the room owner (under Miscellaneous)

- Added the option to customize the tag for Info messages under Miscellaneous

  - Can be set to "BOT" (default), "SYSTEM", or none (just a gear icon)

## Bots

- Quote bot random commands (`/quote random`, `/quote guess`) no longer quote commands and  guesses/hints

- Rewrote the internal bot system
  
  - Bots can now be added/removed without requiring a room reload

  - The bot list is now dynamic, meaning bots can be added/removed from the site during runtime

  - Bots can now be muted
  
    - Configured in Room Options (Permissions > Mute Bots)

    - When a bot is muted, calling its commands does nothing, and any filter activations are suppressed

    - Commands for muted bots do not show up in the command helper

    - Just like with users, the room owner has the option to unmute bots early, and a 'MUTED' tag shows up on the members page for muted bots

  - Improvements to bot speed and memory efficiency

- In the bot list, bots now:

  - Show who they were created by

  - Show a preview of their description

  - Display the total number of rooms they are in

  - Show a check next to their name if they are considered trustworthy

- Changes to bot info cards

  - Now show who the bot was created by

  - Now show the total number of rooms the bot in is

- Bots considered trustworthy now have a check in their 'BOT' tag

  - All system bots are considered trustworthy, except for InspiroBot

- The bot list is now sorted by bot room count, rather than alphabetical order of names

  - **Note:** DMs are excluded from bot room counts, as members cannot control which bots are added

- In the create room menu, you can now choose which bots will be added to the room

  - Archive Bot and Random Bot are no longer added to new rooms by default

- Bots can now have a separate "beta" version

  - Beta versions of bots have a screwdriver and wrench next to their name

  - Beta bots are private, only the person who created them can add them to rooms

  - Rooms owners can choose whether or not beta bots can be added to their room (Room Options > Miscellaneous)

- Added the ability for users to create bots through User Bots (see below)

## User Bots

  - Can be hidden under Settings > People > Schedules

## Users

- Added activity viewing; you can now see how often people are online in each period

  - Data from the current or next period is displayed as an activity bar in user cards

    - <img src="/public/images/activity-2.png" alt="An activity bar, as shown in user cards" width="30%">

    - When the school day is over (or when it's a weekend), it instead shows how often they are online

      - <img src="/public/images/activity-4.png" alt="An activity bar on a weekend" width="30%">

  - Clicking on the activity bar shows a more detailed overview, and a breakdown by period

    - <img src="/public/images/activity-3.png" alt="Activity overview menu" width="30%">

    - <img src="/public/images/activity-1.png" alt="Activity overview by period" width="30%">

- The site now loads slightly faster

- Status update notifications are now auto-dismissed and replaced if the sender updates their status again before the notification is read

- Switched the site emoji picker from [Picmo](https://www.npmjs.com/package/picmo) (which is now deprecated and no longer works on some browsers) to [EmojiMart](https://www.npmjs.com/package/emoji-mart)

  - The emoji picker now supports dark mode, and is faster than before

- Improvements to the internal schedule system; it now makes use of the upcoming [Temporal](https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/docs/) date-time API via a [polyfill](https://github.com/fullcalendar/temporal-polyfill)

  - Schedules now always use central time (UTC-5/UTC-6) regardless of locale

## Bugs Fixed

All bugs listed below were present in some or all older versions but have been patched in v3.3.8

- Rooms with one message are not properly converted to the new last read message format, causing an irremovable notification*

- Attempting to open a room with one or zero messages causes a crash*

- The link to the largest file on the stats page does not work

- Navigating to `/chat` without a trailing slash prevents all site files from loading

- Message authors' profile pictures can sometimes get squished

- You still receive status update notifications from people you've blocked

- If you get removed from a room and rejoin it in the same session, new messages sent in that room fail to render until you reload

- If you get removed from a room and then a message is sent in another room, the sidebar item for the room that you were removed from reappears until you reload

- When someone is removed from a room, their read message icons are not deleted

- When you are removed from/leave a room with unread messages, the notification count in the page title is not updated

- If an invite user poll is active, inviting that person before the poll ends results in them being added to the room twice

- When the room name/emoji/options are updated, the most recent message that you read is marked as unread

- If you do not have a status set, various site functions such as auto-reconnect, alerts, notifications, and sidebar alerts do not work, while others (time formatting) behave erratically

- Under certain conditions, online users are given the "OFFLINE" tag despite appearing under the online list on the sidebar

- While [v3.0's update log](/updates/v3.0.0.md?parse=true#bots) claims that bots can only be activated once per message, that is not actually the case

- Setting a status when you don't already have status set causes a site crash
