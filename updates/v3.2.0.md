## Bugs Fixed

All bugs listed below were present in v3.1.0 and are no longer present in v3.2.0

- Clicking on a reply link to scroll up to the message being replied to results in the entire page being scrolled, creating a white box on the bottom of the page

- If you click on any non-chat tab in a room, close the room, and reopen it, the message bar will show up on the non-chat tab

- On the leaderboard, edited and webhook messages do not count towards the amount of messages someone sent

- Non-room-owners can select/deselect checkboxes on the room options page (doesn't actually change anything, it's only visual)

- Saying the word "size" in a room causes that room's stats page to permanently break

- Attempting to delete a message with attached media causes the site to crash

- The emoji selector can sometimes be displayed off-screen

# Notes

Honestly there is nothing really to say about this one besides the fact that unfortunately the release date is april fools day. The next major update will be big though, I promise.
