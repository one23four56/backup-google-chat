## Bugs Fixed

All bugs listed below were present in v3.1.0 and are no longer present in v3.2.0

- Clicking on a reply link to scroll up to the message being replied to results in the entire page being scrolled, creating a white box on the bottom of the page

- If you click on any non-chat tab in a room, close the room, and reopen it, the message bar will show up on the non-chat tab

- On the leaderboard, edited and webhook messages do not count towards the amount of messages someone sent

- Non-room-owners can select/deselect checkboxes on the room options page (doesn't actually change anything, it's only visual)

- Saying the word "size" in a room causes that room's stats page to permanently break

- Attempting to delete a message with attached media causes the site to crash
