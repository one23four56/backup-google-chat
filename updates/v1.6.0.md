## Performance Improvements

| Function | Before v1.6 | After v1.6 | Change % |
|-|-|-|-|
| Adding/removing reactions | ~ 500 milliseconds | > 0.5 milliseconds | ↓ 99.90% |
| Editing messages | ~ 1500 milliseconds | > 1 millisecond | ↓ 99.93% |
| Deleting messages | ~ 1000 milliseconds | > 0.5 milliseconds | ↓ 99.95% |
| Sending messages (regular) | ~ 200 milliseconds | > 0.75 milliseconds | ↓ 99.63% |
| Sending messages (webhooks/bots) | ~ 200 milliseconds | > 1 millisecond | ↓ 99.50% |
| Voting in a poll | ~ 200 milliseconds | > 0.5 milliseconds | ↓ 99.75% |

*Please note that:  
The numbers above are only for server processing time, so latency is not factored in  
The numbers above are deliberately vague because times can vary  
The numbers above were tested on an archive with ~19,000 messages, but times may increase/decrease with message count*

Other functions that received non-measured speed improvements:

- Archive Bot `/stats` command

## Full Changelog

- **Performance**
  - Added new higher-performance module for interacting with JSONs
  - Overall performance-enhancing optimizations
  - Massive performance improvements to archive-related server-side request processing:
    - The archive is now stored in memory and on the disk
      - Previously it was only stored on the disk, requiring it to be read and parsed whenever a change was made
    - Decreased the prevalence of resource-intensive "deep copying" of the archive
    - Writing the archive to the disk is now done asynchronously
    - See the [table](#performance-improvements) above
- **Stability**
  - Increased protection against malformed requests that could crash the site
- **Site Changes**
  - Sidebar can now scroll when there are too many items
  - Documentation button moved to below online list
  - Notices button added to the side bar; opens the notices page
  - GitHub button added to the side bar; opens the github repo or a 404 page if you don't have access
- **URL Shortener**
  - Added a built-in url shortener
  - Open with Ctrl+S
- **Update Logs**
  - Notices/Documents moved off of update logs and to their own designated page
- **Bots**
  - Polly bot now accepts `/polly` as an alias for `/poll`
- **Quality-of-Life Changes**
  - Your current selected webhook is now cleared only if it was edited or deleted
  - Clicking on a message now selects it
  - Pressing A, E, D, or R triggers an action on the selected message:
    - A: React
    - E: Edit
    - D: Delete

- **Bugs Fixed**
  - Whenever someone connects or adds/edits/deletes a webhook your current selected webhook is cleared
