v1.6.0  
Released: To Be Determined  
Note: This update is in beta

## Highlights

- MASSIVE performance improvements (see [table](#performance-improvements) below)
- Improvements to stability
- Added a built-in url shortener, opened with Ctrl+S

## Performance Improvements

| Function | Before v1.6 | After v1.6 | Change % |
|-|-|-|-|
| Adding/removing reactions | ~ 0.5 seconds | > 0.5 milliseconds | ↓ 99.90% |
| Editing messages | ~ 1.5 seconds | > 1 millisecond | ↓ 99.93% |
| Deleting messages | ~ 1 second | > 0.5 milliseconds | ↓ 99.95% |
| Sending messages (regular) | ~ 0.2 seconds | > 0.75 milliseconds | ↓ 99.63% |
| Sending messages (webhooks/bots) | ~ 0.2 seconds | > 1 millisecond | ↓ 99.50% |

*Please note that:  
The numbers above are only for server processing time, so latency is not factored in  
The numbers above are deliberately vague because times can vary  
The numbers above were tested on an archive with ~19,000 messages, but times may increase/decrease with message count*

## Full Changelog

- **Performance**
  - Added new higher-performance module for interacting with JSONs
  - Overall performance-enhancing optimizations
  - Massive performance improvements to archive-related server-side request processing:
    - The archive is now stored in memory and on the disk
      - Previously it was only stored on the disk, requiring it to be read and parsed whenever a change was made
    - Decreased the prevalence of resource-intensive "deep copying" of the archive
    - Writing to the archive is now done asynchronously
    - See the [table](#performance-improvements) above
- **Stability**
  - Increased protection against malformed requests that could crash the site
- **Site Changes**
  - Sidebar can now scroll when there are too many items
  - 'Documentation' button moved to below online list
- **URL Shortener**
  - Added a built-in url shortener
  - Open with Ctrl+S
