# Optimization Update Patch 1

v1.3.1  
Released: March 27th, 2022 (3/27/2022)

## Changes

- **Security**
  - Patched critical XSS vulnerability in the Archive Viewer
- **Style**
  - Minor style changes
- **Update Logs**
  - Added a note next to a bug fix in v1.3.0 saying that I know the fix doesn't work for old messages in a (probably futile) attempt to stop someone from reporting and/or complaining about it again.
