  - Unlike other polls, this poll has 2 no votes by default

- Webhook options have been moved to the bottom of the room options tab

## Messages

- Non-saved messages now have a 'NOT SAVED' tag

- Non-saved messages no longer join with saved messages

- Non-saved messages now have a purple asterisk after them

## Minor Changes

- Dependencies updated

## Bugs Fixed

All bugs listed here were present in older versions but have been patched in this update and are no longer present.

- After renouncing ownership of any room, permission options set to "poll" are reset to "anyone", while this should only happen with permissions set to "owner"*

- Deleting the last message you read resets your read messages

- When room options are updated, the message you are typing gets reset

- Sending a non-saved message results in a 'failed to read message' error popping up

- Webhook messages sent back-to-back by the same person using different webhooks are joined together

\* = This bug was patched in a hotfix before the official patch was released
