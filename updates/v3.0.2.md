# Full Changelog

## Rooms

- Rooms now have to have 3 or more members in order for the owner to be able to renounce their ownership

- Anyone (not just the former owner) can now start a poll to claim an abandoned room (a room with no owner)

  - Unlike other polls, this poll has 2 no votes by default

## Minor Changes

- Dependencies updated

## Bugs Fixed

All bugs listed here were present in older versions but have been patched in this update and are no longer present.

- After renouncing ownership of any room, permission options set to "poll" are reset to "anyone", while this should only happen with permissions set to "owner"*

\* = This bug was patched in a hotfix before the official patch was released
